### Hi there 👋 👩🏾‍💻  [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=linkedin&labelColor=blue)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fitsum-sileshi)

My experience largely involves on full stack development [backend engineering and frontend engineering] and cloud infrastructure, and I believe I can gain more expertise on my current experience allowing me to learn and contribute at the same time. 

I want to work with senior engineers, PMs, designers, and other stakeholders on both the project planning and architecture of the project.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Cloud(AWS) and Security 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help me learn
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding projects to work on
- 📫 How to reach me: fitsum.sileshi@a2SV.org
